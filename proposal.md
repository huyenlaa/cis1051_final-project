# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?
Fakiro 

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A game with a similar concept to the Mario games. It has a few stages, and the player has to complete all in order to win the game. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Our software will run a game similar to the games in the Mario franchise. The game will include several creatures with different abilities that will act as obstacles for the player to get past. The player will need to reach an endpoint in order to complete the level. There will be 3 levels in the game for each difficulty. There will be one easy, one medium, and one hard level. The project will be done with pygame. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Group:
Huyen La, tup07308@temple.edu, TA: Bryan Li
Danny Mei, tut53875@temple.edu, TA: Xinwen (Ellen) Zhang 
Joshua Okah, tut17937@temple.edu TA: Elmira Talebianaraki and Kora Sen

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Features : 
Single player
3 levels
Monsters with different abilities / obstacles 


### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Features: 
Secret boss 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Features: 
Multiplayer 


## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

One new skill we may need to acquire is sprite creation, as we will need to create sprites for the characters in our game. We will need to research how to use pygame and create a game with it. We will also need to learn the limitations of what we can and can not do with pygame. We will discuss who does what when we begin the project.
